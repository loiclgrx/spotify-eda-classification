## Introduction

In this project, we perform EDA and classification on Spotify song data to uncover insights and patterns. The analysis helps in understanding the characteristics of songs and predicting categories such as genre or popularity.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project include various features of songs available on Spotify. These features may include:
- Acousticness
- Danceability
- Energy
- Instrumentalness
- Liveness
- Speechiness
- Tempo
- Valence

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

You can clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/loiclgrx/spotify-eda-classification.git
cd spotify-eda-classification
```

Then you can install the necessary packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 

You can simply open and run the Jupyter Notebook `spotify_eda_classification.ipynb` to see the analysis and results.

## EDA

The EDA section of the notebook includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of song features
- Correlation analysis
- Insights into trends and patterns

## Classification

In the classification section, various machine learning models are implemented to predict song categories. The models include:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines

## Results

The results of the classification models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualization of model performance is also included.

## Contributions

This project was part of a course from the engineering school IMT Nord Europe which I took along my classmate:
